                <b class="category">Description</b>:<br> 
                The "Sonny Angel Projector" jack-in-the-box device created using Arduino combines mechanical motion with user 
                interaction to deliver a surprise experience. At its core, the device comprises a toggle switch, a potentiometer, 
                a servo motor, and a stepper motor, all orchestrated by an Arduino microcontroller. The toggle switch serves as the 
                trigger mechanism, initiating the sequence when activated. The potentiometer, positioned to the right of the toggle,
                 acts as the probability dial, allowing users to adjust the likelihood of receiving a Sonny Angel figurine upon activation.

                <br>
                Upon triggering the toggle switch, the servo motor swings into action, rotating precisely 100 degrees to lift 
                the lid of the jack-in-the-box, revealing its contents. Simultaneously, the Arduino interprets the position of
                 the potentiometer, determining the probability of the outcome. With the potentiometer set to the rightmost position,
                  corresponding to 100% probability, the chance of receiving a Sonny Angel figurine is maximized, while setting it to 
                  the leftmost position results in a 0% probability, ensuring a "try again" outcome.

                The Arduino then engages the stepper motor to dispense the selected item. A sequence of 60 steps is executed,
                 each separated by a 5000 microsecond delay, ensuring smooth and controlled movement. The direction of rotation is 
                 determined by the calculated outcome, either towards the compartment containing the Sonny Angel figurine or the 
                 "try again" panel.

                 Once the selection process is completed, the servo motor swings back into action, rotating another 100 degrees 
                 in the opposite direction to gracefully close the lid of the jack-in-the-box, concealing its contents once more.
                  This cyclical operation ensures the device is ready for subsequent activations, providing endless amusement and 
                  surprise for its users.

                The mechanical design of the device encompasses precise motor control, seamless motion, and intuitive user interaction,
                 resulting in a captivating and entertaining experience reminiscent of traditional jack-in-the-box toys, albeit with 
                 a modern twist. Below is a simplified sketch illustrating the layout and components of the device:
